### START
Install npm modules: run `npm i`

Run the build script: run `npm run build`

Start the application: run `npm start`
#
### Linting

Linting will be done with each commit, but if you want to check for errors you can run:

for js and jsx files: `npm run lint:js`

for css files: `npm run lint:css`
#
### Prettier

Run `npm run format` for code formatting. The script will be run with each commit, also.
